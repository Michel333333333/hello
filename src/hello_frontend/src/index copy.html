        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This website is a tribute to the amazing hamster named Coconut. She loved sunflower seeds and hanging out. She never bit a human and wasn't shy of cuddles. If you were having a bad day, she'd be the first to comfort you. She was born October 2020, and passed in the winter of 2022. To the best hamster that ever lived, Coconut, we love you. </p>
